To use .exe files in this directory:
- Open CMD and change directory to /bin
- Run a file by typing its name. For fileinfo and filecount, follow the program with 'text.txt' as such: 'filecount text.txt' to run them on the text.txt file in the /files directory.
- Note: the programs use relative path to look for files in the /files folder, and will only work if run in the same directory architecture as on github.
